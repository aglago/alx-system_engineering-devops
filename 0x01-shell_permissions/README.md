## Shell permissions

### All files in this directory are executable files. 
*what is an executable file?*
+ they are files that contain instructions to perform specific tasks
+ e.g. the /bin directory contains all sysetem-wide executable files like ls, mkdir, touch, pwd
+ inside these files are defined rules and instructions that tells the computer what to do if any of these files are executed.
+ the computer understands to list all files and directories when the `ls` file is executed.

*why are paths not specified for system defined executable files like* `ls` *and* `touch` *etc?*
+ there is a Linux variable called `PATH` which contains commonly used path names.
+ when an executable file is passed as a command without its path been specified, LINUX searches through the `PATH` variable 
+ to find where the file is located. once file is found, LINUX executes it with the instructions specified in it.
